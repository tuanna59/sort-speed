# Sort Speed

## Description:
### This program requires you to write three text oriented console input/output programs.  These three programs do the following things:
1.	Read in a text file that contains words, punctuation and many other things (e.g. numbers).  This first program reads in this file and writes out a file of words, one per line, where only whole words formed of just alphabetic characters (no internal blanks, dashes, or other special characters) from the input are written to an output file and the number of words is written to the console (each word in the output file must be unique.)
2.	The second program reads and sorts a specified file (created by the first program) into memory after the user specifies the name of the file and the number of words.  The program sorts this unsorted data five times using five different sorting algorithms: bubble, selection, insertion, merge, and one other sort of your choice that must be faster than O(n2).  (You should read in the unsorted data into memory just before each sort.  Be sure that you do not include this reading time as part of the sorting time.)   The intent of the fifth sort is that it should be faster than the other four and the performance of this sort will be used as your result for the speed competition.  Each of the five actual sorting process (not including the time to read in the data or the time to write out the results) will be timed and the amount of time spent on each of the five sorting algorithms will be displayed to the console.  After each sort, the resulting sorted array will be written to an output file generated by adding the name of the sort to the specified input file name before the “.” extension at the end of the input file name.
3.	The third program reads in the five input files and verifies that each is the same by comparing each to the other and also verifies that the results are indeed sorted.  The results are displayed to the console.
### The objectives of this assignment are to:
1.	Explore the implementation of sorting algorithms.
2.	Experiment with sorting performance by finding a sort algorithm that out-performs, if possible, your merge sort implementation.
3.	Further develop skills producing Java applications.
